			<h2>
				Manifesto of Futurism
			</h2>
			<p>
				1.
				<br>
				We want to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and rashness.
			</p>
			<p>
				2.
				<br>
				The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity and revolt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				3.
				<br>
				Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and slumber. We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness, the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow with the fist.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. 
				<br>
				We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. 
			</p>
			<p>
				5.
				<br>
				We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which crosses the earth, itself hurled along its orbit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				6.
				<br>
				The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				7.
				<br>
				Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				8.
				<br>
				We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use of looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters of the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We are already living in the absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				9.
				<br>
				We want to glorify war - the only cure for the world - militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas which kill, and contempt for woman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				10.
				<br>
				We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				11.
				<br>
				We will sing of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and revolt; the multi-colored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern capitals: the gluttonous railway stations devouring smoking serpents; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across the diabolic cutlery of sunny rivers.

				Museums, cemeteries! Truly identical in their sinister juxtaposition of bodies that do not know each other. Public dormitories where you sleep side by side for ever with beings you hate or do not know. Reciprocal ferocity of the painters and sculptors who murder each other in the same museum with blows of line and color. To make a visit once a year, as one goes to see the graves of our dead once a year, that we could allow! We can even imagine placing flowers once a year at the feet of the Gioconda! But to take our sadness, our fragile courage and our anxiety to the museum every day, that we cannot admit! Do you want to poison yourselves? Do you want to rot? 
			</p>
			<p>
				To admire an old picture is to pour our sensibility into a funeral urn instead of casting it forward with violent spurts of creation and action. Do you want to waste the best part of your strength in a useless admiration of the past, from which you will emerge exhausted, diminished, trampled on? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed daily visits to museums, libraries and academies (those cemeteries of wasted effort, calvaries of crucified dreams, registers of false starts!) is for artists what prolonged supervision by the parents is for intelligent young men, drunk with their own talent and ambition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the dying, for invalids and for prisoners it may be all right. It is, perhaps, some sort of balm for their wounds, the admirable past, at a moment when the future is denied them. But we will have none of it, we, the young, strong and living Futurists! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Let the good incendiaries with charred fingers come! Here they are! Heap up the fire to the shelves of the libraries! Divert the canals to flood the cellars of the museums! Let the glorious canvases swim ashore! Take the picks and hammers! Undermine the foundation of venerable towns! 
			</p>
			<p>
				The oldest among us are not yet thirty, and yet we have already wasted treasures, treasures of strength, love, courage and keen will, hastily, deliriously, without thinking, with all our might, till we are out of breath. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at us! We are not out of breath, our hearts are not in the least tired. For they are nourished by fire, hatred and speed! Does this surprise you? it is because you do not even remember being alive! Standing on the world's summit, we launch once more our challenge to the stars! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your objections? All right! I know them! Of course! We know just what our beautiful false intelligence affirms: `We are only the sum and the prolongation of our ancestors,' it says. Perhaps! All right! What does it matter? But we will not listen! Take care not to repeat those infamous words! Instead, lift up your head! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Standing on the world's summit we launch once again our insolent challenge to the stars!
