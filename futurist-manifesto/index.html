								Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and slumber. We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness, the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow with the&nbsp;fist.

								We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: <span class="highlight">beauty of speed.</span> A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of&nbsp;Samothrace.

								We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use of looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters of the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday.

						It is from Italy that we launch through the world this violently upsetting incendiary manifesto of ours. With it, today, we establish Futurism, because we want to free this land from its smelly gangrene of professors, archaeologists, ciceroni and antiquarians. For too long has Italy been a dealer in second-hand clothes. <span class="highlight">We mean to free her from the numberless museums that cover her like so many graveyards.</span>
					</p>
					<div class="selected-container">
						<p>
							<span class="p-deco">Museums</span> <span class="p-deco">cemeteries</span>
							<br>
							Truly identical in their sinister juxtaposition of bodies that do not know each other. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Public dormitories where you sleep side by side for ever with beings you hate or do not know. Reciprocal ferocity of the painters and sculptors who murder each other in the same museum with blows of line and color. 
					</p>
					<p class="bolded-text">
						To make a visit once a year, as one goes to see the graves of our dead once a year, that we could allow!
					</p>
					<p>
						We can even imagine placing flowers once a year at the feet of the Gioconda! But to take our sadness, our fragile courage and our anxiety to the museum every day, that we cannot admit!

								Do you want to poison yourselves? Do you want to rot?

						To admire an old picture is to pour our sensibility into a funeral urn instead of casting it forward with violent spurts of creation and action. <span class="highlight">Do you want to waste the best part of your strength in a useless admiration of the past,</span> from which you will emerge exhausted, diminished, trampled on? 
					</p>
					<p>
						Indeed daily visits to museums, libraries and academies (those cemeteries of wasted effort, calvaries of crucified dreams, registers of false starts!) is for artists what prolonged supervision by the parents is for intelligent young men, drunk with their own talent and ambition. 
					</p>
					<p class="bolded-text">
						For the dying, for invalids and for prisoners it may be all right. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It is, perhaps, some sort of balm for their wounds, the admirable past, <span class="highlight">at a moment when the future is denied them.</span> But we will have none of it, we, the young, strong and living Futurists!

							The Glory

					</div>
					<p>
						Let the good incendiaries with charred fingers come! Here they are! Heap up the fire to the shelves of the libraries! Divert the canals to flood the cellars of the museums! Let the glorious canvases swim ashore! <span class="highlight">Take the picks and hammers! Undermine the foundation of venerable towns!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						The oldest among us are not yet thirty, and yet we have already wasted treasures, treasures of strength, love, courage and keen will, hastily, deliriously, without thinking, with all our might, till we are out of breath. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Look at us! We are not out of breath, <span class="highlight">our hearts are not in the least tired.</span> For they are nourished by fire, hatred and speed! Does this surprise you? it is because you do not even remember being alive! 
					</p>
					<p class="bolded-text">
						Your objections? All right! I know them! Of course! 
					</p>
					<p>
						We know just what our beautiful false intelligence affirms: `We are only the sum and the prolongation of our ancestors,' it says. Perhaps! All right! What does it matter? But we will not listen! Take care not to repeat those infamous words! Instead, lift up your head!
