<h1>Project 3: Binding </h1>

<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>
  This project is to design and develop a responsive website assignment for the MPS Communication Design course, Typography and Interaction Design 1. The core goal was to master responsive web design principles among multiple pages using modern CSS techniques while adhering to specific typographic and functional constraints.
</p>

<p>
The site curates and presents three distinct texts reflecting on the relationship between technology, domestic life, and artistic expression, specifically contrasting early 20th-century futurism with contemporary digital anxieties.
</p>


<h2>📚 Curated Articles </h2>

<p>The content of this website is pulled directly from the following three articles:</p>

<p>The Futurist Manifesto by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1909)</p>

<p>Honeywell, I'm home! by Justin McGuirk (2015)</p>

<p>The Good Room by Frank Chimero (2018)</p>


<h2>✨ Technical & Design Highlights</h2>

<p>This project was built using pure HTML and CSS, showcasing advanced styling and layout techniques, many of which were learned and implemented for the first time.</p>

<p>CSS Grid for Main Layout: The core layout utilizes CSS Grid to establish two distinct structures:</p>

<p>Mobile (< 1000px): A single-column, stacked layout (nav, article, footer).</p>

<p>Desktop (> 1000px): A two-column structure featuring a sticky navigation sidebar and main content area.</p>

<p>CSS Fluid Units: Extensive use of CSS variables (var(--spacing)) and calc() ensures all sizing, spacing, and typography scale fluidly across different viewports.</p>


<h2>Custom Visual Effects</h2>

<p>Complex Geometric Shapes (Bevels & Cuts): Achieved precise corner transformations using the clip-path property to create angular cuts on headings and containers (e.g., the .folded-container effect). </p>

<p>Pixel Icon Design: Used the box-shadow property with multiple offsets and spreads to construct custom, pixelated shapes and icons (like the question mark or numbers) purely through CSS, avoiding raster graphics.</p>

<p>Custom Borders & Shadows: Implemented detailed box shadows that are offset (e.g., 0.6em -0.6em) and combined with borders to create a layered, graphic, 3D effect. </p>


<h2>🎓 Key Technical Learnings</h2>

<h3>The development process provided hands-on experience with the following crucial concepts:</h3>

<p>Using Flexbox and Grid fluidly in responsive design (switching from stacked to sidebar layouts).</p>

<p>Writing media queries for different breakpoints and print settings.</p>

<p>Animating text by using only CSS elements (e.g., Keyframes and transform: scaleY() for stretching/shrinking bars).</p>

<p>Implementing a hanging quote or drop cap effect on blockquote and the .numbers element.</p>
